These are the python files that handle the switching of sockets

1: switch_control.py
  Module that wraps the control of the engergenie sockets into one function. 
  Import this into any file that wants control of the sockets. 
  Then use function 'switch_socket(socket, switch)' to set each socket
  Use close() to cleanup the GPIO pins on the pi and exit the program
  
  TO DO:
  - Tidy up code
  - Find a better way to exit safely
  
2: web_file_control.py
  The module continually checks the file that the webpage writes to
  and switches the states of the sockets according to the file.
  
  TO DO:
  - find something safe to do if an 'on' or 'off' is not found in the file
  - add close() to the exception when something isn't right
    > catch if it is an error with the file or something else
    > create a queue if the file is unavailable
  - use logging instead of print()
  - consider only sending a switch command if there is a change to the switch state
